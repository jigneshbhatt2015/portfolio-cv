                <h1 class="text-uppercase text-capitalize">The Need For Embracing Change</h1>
                <img src="img/blog/blog-post-35.jfif" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog image" style="margin:0 32%;" />
                <div class="blog-excerpt open-sans-font pb-5">
                    <p><br/>“Change is a new Constant” is a cliché we’ve heard all our lives. Embracing change is not an option now but a must for each of us to grow & blossom in every area of our life. Change often brings positives to your life. The ones who accept change are the ones who achieve those greatest levels of success. Successful people understand the dynamism of the environment & the world we live in. So instead of cringing or sulking towards change, they accept it as a part of their life & develop a healthy relationship with the discomforts that change brings with it. Embracing change is the only way to bring happiness and glory to your life.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, some people succumb to & express displeasure in adapting to any change that life wants them to. Instead of looking at it as an opportunity to grow and prosper, it is being viewed as a doomsday. That’s because they either think they’re not ready for it or they don’t want to leave their current state. It does take a hard grind to unlearn and relearn new things, but it often takes you closer to your goals & enables you to reach greater heights than you’d have initially thought of. On a contrary, adventurous people keep looking out for a change and they feel bored if life pans out in a certain way as planned or predicted. New changes excite them and keep them afloat. It adds that spice in their life to live it in a cheerful way. Change might appear stressful & painful in the beginning, but embracing it is the only way to ensure survival & staying ahead in all walks of life. Hence changing your perception towards change & accepting it with enough optimism can help you in dealing with change smoothly.</p>
                    <p>Another factor that keeps people from change is their fear. It is the fear of the unknown that grips them to take any meaningful action towards adapting it. The new state that any change brings in your life fills you with doubt & anxiety as you move from your previous state. People who successfully embrace change view this fear as a mirage & gather tremendous courage to overcome it & take full control of the situation they’re in. They back their instincts and trust their capabilities to deal with any challenge that life throws at them. They understand that any failure or setback they encounter would eventually give them great returns if dealt with in the right manner. For some people, it is the passion & drive towards results that take them to overcome fear and overcome those initial hurdles of embracing change.</p>
                    <p>Accepting the challenge is a way to take yourself a notch ahead in anything you intend to do and help bridge talent gaps in any area you potentially fall short of. In life, things don’t happen the way you’ve planned and so it is imperative for you to keep changing your plans and adapt to change as quickly as possible. You need to upskill yourself & delve into areas that could be new or tangential to your core competency. Initially, it might appear too overwhelming and you would be tempted to quit but staying on course and moving gradually & consistently is the only key to emerge successfully from it.</p>
                    <p>Extrapolating this entire concept of change to the corporate world, we would find many organizations implementing their change management strategy only to let their businesses respond faster to market changes. Their need of internalizing an agile culture in them only rose from their quest of embracing change more often than ever before. The success criteria of customer delivery have changed over time which has forced organizations to adopt tools & methodologies like DevOps, Scrum, etc. Faster time to market, efficiency & productivity, empathy towards people, offering a complete package of products & services are a few new ways businesses are adapting to. Businesses are constantly looking at their competitors & their offerings, understanding the changing business dynamics and the marketspace they operate in.</p>
                    <p>The previous year (2020) is the greatest example of when we witnessed change and disruption at a massive level. It taught us why it is required for us to come out of our comfort zone time & again. Every financial recession brings many to move out of their so-called “stable” jobs to owning a venture, either forcefully (firing from their job) or in the desire of having multiple sources of income only to achieve their financial security. We are aware of companies who were riding on the wave at once, went out of their business only because they failed to adapt to the changing business climate. Companies like Sears who lost their significant market share to Walmart and the most popular Kodak who had to file bankruptcy for losing track of the digital wave are testimonies to the fact that embracing change is a need & not just a good-to-do thing.</p>
                    <p>Growth can only come to you when you make the change as a key element in your life. You cannot keep doing the same things & expect different results. Right from an industrial revolution to this Digital era, we’ve seen disruptions and innovations that companies brought in to bring transformation across all facets of society & businesses. Transformation is not an event but a journey that successful companies embark on. Similarly, even in an entire lifespan of an individual, one goes through many changes (forced & voluntarily) only to evolve oneself into something better. Adapting to something new is always a challenge but once transitioned, it brings laurels to your life. Humans get easily habituated to any new state with time & changing states frequently only motivates them to keep embracing change. It is the change that you adapt, and internalize that makes this world a renewed & perfect place to live in. I would like to conclude with a quote by our esteemed Mr. Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
                    <p><q>You must be the change you want to see in the world.</q></p>
